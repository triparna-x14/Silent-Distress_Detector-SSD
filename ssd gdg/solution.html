        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>The proposed system, Silent Distress Detector (SSD), is a software-based sensor intelligence system that passively monitors abnormal inactivity patterns using sensors already available in smartphones or wearable devices.</p>
        <h3>Working Principle</h3>
        <p>The system first learns the user’s normal daily activity pattern.</p>
        <p>It continuously monitors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Movement data (accelerometer, gyroscope)</li>
            <li>Interaction activity (screen usage, touch)</li>
            <li>Context information (time, environment)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a rare and abnormal combination is detected—such as sudden prolonged stillness during normally active periods—the system identifies a possible silent distress event.</p>
        <p>If the user does not respond to a soft confirmation alert, the system automatically sends a silent emergency notification to a predefined contact.</p>
        <p>The system does not rely on voice, video, or manual input and functions completely in the background.</p>
