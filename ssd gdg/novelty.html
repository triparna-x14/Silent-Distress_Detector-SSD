        <h2>Novelty of the Proposed Work</h2>
        <p>The novelty of this project lies in its new interpretation of sensor data for emergency detection.</p>
        <p>It introduces the concept of “silent distress”, which is not addressed by traditional SOS or fall-detection systems.</p>
        <p>The system uses negative sensing, where the absence of expected activity is treated as a critical signal.</p>
        <p>Unlike existing solutions, it does not require active user interaction, making it suitable for real-life situations where the user is unable to respond.</p>
        <p>The solution is purely software-based, using existing sensors without additional hardware or medical devices.</p>
        <p>To the best of our knowledge, no existing system or research work specifically focuses on detecting silent personal distress through inactivity-based sensor fusion.</p>
        <h3>Novelty Justification Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>“This project introduces a novel approach for detecting silent personal distress by analyzing abnormal inactivity patterns using existing device sensors. Unlike traditional emergency systems that rely on active user input or explicit events, the proposed system passively identifies distress situations through software-based negative sensing, which is not addressed in existing solutions.”</blockquote>
        <p>Unnoticed personal emergency means a dangerous situation where a person needs help, but no one realizes it.</p>
        <p>It happens when a person suddenly feels weak, panics, faints, or is mentally frozen and cannot call or ask for help.</p>
        <p>There may be no loud noise, fall, or visible sign of danger.</p>
        <p>Because the person stays silent or still, the emergency goes unnoticed by others.</p>
        <p>The idea is to detect emergencies when a person cannot ask for help.</p>
        <p>The system watches sensor data to notice unusual inactivity.</p>
        <p>If the user does not respond, it automatically alerts a trusted contact.</p>
